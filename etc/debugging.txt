- backtracking during phrase building

goal: longest possible phrase less than max_length

I really don't need a iterator that can flip, I need to:
- decide to move backward
- remove latest word from the phrase
- see if new end word can be an ending
- if not, continue moving backwards
- if I become less than min_length, fail
- could go back and forth between min_length and max_length until I find a bit, but risky
for infinite loops, could keep a max_turns variable and fail after 


iterator = NxGraphRandomIterator(graph, start_node)
while iterator.has_next()
    word = iterator.next()
    phrase += word
    
    if length > max_length
        if can_end
            break
        else
            iterator.flip()

goal: 2nd order markov chain

when searching for a node I need to say "has these 2 as immediate predecessors".  networkx may have some built-in functionality to do this.
