patrick.bateman,"I don't want to get you drunk, but, ah, that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking."
patrick.bateman,"Harold, it's Bateman, Patrick Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know: I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people. And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open."
patrick.bateman,"You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood."
patrick.bateman,I want you to clean your vagina.
patrick.bateman,'Oh Africa Brave Africa'. It was... a laugh riot.
patrick.bateman,I'm on a diet.
patrick.bateman,"Not quite blonde, are we? More of a dirty blonde."
patrick.bateman,I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
patrick.bateman,"There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."
patrick.bateman,"I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip."
patrick.bateman,Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
patrick.bateman,"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite."
patrick.bateman,Wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
patrick.bateman,He was into that whole Yale thing.
patrick.bateman,"I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke. I don't think we should see each other any more."
patrick.bateman,"There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself; no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing."
patrick.bateman,"Paul Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P; and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut."
patrick.bateman,Do you like Huey Lewis and the news?
patrick.bateman,"Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole."
patrick.bateman,I have to return some videotapes.
patrick.bateman,"You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?"
patrick.bateman,Get a god-damn job Al.
patrick.bateman,"I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?"
patrick.bateman,"Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?"
patrick.bateman,Ask me a question.
patrick.bateman,"Jean, I'm not going to make it... I'm not going to... make it... to the office this afternoon."
patrick.bateman,Just say no.
patrick.bateman,"Hey, I'm a child of divorce, gimme a break!"
patrick.bateman,Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
patrick.bateman,"Your compliment was sufficient, Luis."
patrick.bateman,"I'm leaving. I've assessed the situation, and I'm going."
patrick.bateman,"Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about."
patrick.bateman,"I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."
patrick.bateman,"Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie?"
patrick.bateman,The world just opens up and swallows them.
patrick.bateman,"Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed."
patrick.bateman,"Hamilton, have a holly-jolly Christmas."
patrick.bateman,Mistletoe alert!
patrick.bateman,I know my behavior can be... *erratic* sometimes.
patrick.bateman,"I think, um, Evelyn that, uh, we've lost touch."
patrick.bateman,Negative. Cancel it.
patrick.bateman,What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
patrick.bateman,"No... Yeah, I mean yeah, in the Times."
patrick.bateman,"New York Matinee called it ""a playful but mysterious little dish""."
patrick.bateman,"Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark!"
patrick.bateman,"Evelyn, I'm sorry. I just, uh... you're not terribly important to me."
patrick.bateman,I'm not here.
patrick.bateman,I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
patrick.bateman,I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it.
patrick.bateman,"I'm at a loss. He was part of that whole...""Yale thing""... you know?"
