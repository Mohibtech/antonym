tyler.durden,"Fuck off with your sofa units and strine green stripe patterns, I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve, let the chips fall where they may."
tyler.durden,"Fight Club was the beginning, now it's moved out of the basement, it's called Project Mayhem."
tyler.durden,Only after disaster can we be resurrected.
tyler.durden,"Now, a question of etiquette - as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?"
tyler.durden,Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel's life. His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
tyler.durden,"Hey, you created me. I didn't create some loser alter-ego to make myself feel better. Take some responsibility!"
tyler.durden,Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
tyler.durden,"Fuck damnation, man! Fuck redemption! We are God's unwanted children? So be it!"
tyler.durden,"All right, if the applicant is young, tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. If the applicant then waits for three days without food, shelter, or encouragement he may then enter and begin his training."
tyler.durden,"It's getting exciting now, two and one-half. Think of everything we've accomplished, man. Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history. One step closer to economic equilibrium."
tyler.durden,"Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off."
tyler.durden,"All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not."
tyler.durden,It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
tyler.durden,"In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway."
tyler.durden,"Where'd you go, psycho boy?"
tyler.durden,"You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."
tyler.durden,"Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else."
tyler.durden,"Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club! Third rule of Fight Club: if someone yells ""stop!"", goes limp, or taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: the fights are bare knuckle. No shirt, no shoes, no weapons. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight."
tyler.durden,"Man, you've got some fucked up friends, I'm tellin' ya. Limber, though..."
tyler.durden,The things you own end up owning you.
tyler.durden,"God Damn! We just had a near-life experience, fellas."
tyler.durden,"Like a monkey, ready to be shot into space. Space monkey! Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good."
tyler.durden,OK: any historic figure.
tyler.durden,Did you know that if you mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate you can make napalm?
tyler.durden,You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
tyler.durden,"Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God. If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?"
tyler.durden,Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
tyler.durden,"Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space."
tyler.durden,Do you know what a duvet is?
tyler.durden,It could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.
tyler.durden,"Fuck what you know. You need to forget about what you know, that's your problem. Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me."
tyler.durden,"The salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans."
tyler.durden,"We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra."
tyler.durden,She's a predator posing as a house pet.
tyler.durden,"Tell him. Tell him, The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perceptions."
tyler.durden,Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction...
tyler.durden,Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!
tyler.durden,"WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! Ok, you are now firing a gun at your 'imaginary friend' near 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERINE!"
tyler.durden,I'll bring us through this. As always. I'll carry you - kicking and screaming - and in the end you'll thank me.
tyler.durden,"Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions."
tyler.durden,"You're too old, fat man. Your tits are too big."
tyler.durden,Just tell him you fuckin' did it. Tell him you blew it all up. That's what he wants to hear.
tyler.durden,We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
tyler.durden,Well you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living
tyler.durden,We are all part of the same compost heap.
tyler.durden,"Now, ancient people found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. You know why?"
tyler.durden,"Something on your mind, dear?"
tyler.durden,This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned before. You will have a scar.
tyler.durden,"If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?"
tyler.durden,Warning: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think every thing you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned- Tyler.
tyler.durden,"My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go."
tyler.durden,"If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?"
tyler.durden,"*slaps the Narrator, throws away goggles* Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you, never wanted you, and in all probability, he HATES you. It's not the worst thing that can happen."
