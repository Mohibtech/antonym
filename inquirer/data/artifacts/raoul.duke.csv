raoul.duke,"One of the things you learn from years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye."
raoul.duke,"There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die."
raoul.duke,"Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Has it been five years? Six? It seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. Whatever it meant."
raoul.duke,"There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning."
raoul.duke,"And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back."
raoul.duke,"With a bit of luck, his life was ruined forever. Always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all of his favorite bars, men in red woolen shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know."
raoul.duke,Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich.
raoul.duke,"Look, there's two women fucking a polar bear!"
raoul.duke,Come on you fiend!
raoul.duke,"When I came to, the general back-alley ambience of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul. How long had I been lying there? All these signs of violence. What had happened? There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD. What kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds? Would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries? These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau? Maybe so. But then why all this booze? And these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust? These were not the hoofprints of your average God-fearing junky. It was too savage. Too aggressive."
raoul.duke,"If the pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt the drug culture should be represented as well. And there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas hotel, and then just wheeling across town and checking into another. Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America. Why not? Move confidently into their midst."
raoul.duke,Holy Jesus. What are these goddamn animals?
raoul.duke,A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip.
raoul.duke,"Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. A normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop heart. Make the bastard chase you. He will follow. But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you are about to turn right. This is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk. It will take him a moment to realize that he's about to make a 180 degree turn at speed, but you will be ready for it. Brace for the g's, and fast heel-toe work."
raoul.duke,"There was only one road back to L.A. - U.S. Interstate 15. Just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo. Then onto the Hollywood Freeway, and straight on into frantic oblivion. Safety. Obscurity. Just another freak, in the freak kingdom."
raoul.duke,"We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into locked a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon."
raoul.duke,"How long could we maintain? I wondered. How long until one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family; will he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car? If so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere, 'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency and they'll run us down like dogs. Jesus, did I say that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?"
raoul.duke,"Perhaps, if I explained things, he'd rest easy."
raoul.duke,"There's something you should know... Can you hear me? I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney. He's not just some dingbat I found on the strip, man. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But that doesn't matter, though, does it? Are you prejudiced?"
raoul.duke,Let's get down to brass tacks. How much for the ape?
raoul.duke,"You better take care of me, Lord. If you don't you're gonna have me on your hands."
raoul.duke,"Those of us that had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts, we wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press."
raoul.duke,Ignore this terrible drug. Yeah. Pretend it's not happening.
raoul.duke,"Don't fuck with me now, man, I am Ahab."
raoul.duke,"I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid, wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife."
raoul.duke,"Panic. It crept up my spine like first rising vibes of an acid frenzy. All these horrible realities began to dawn on me. There I was. Alone in Las Vegas, completely twisted on drugs, no cash, no story for the magazine, and on top of everything else, a gigantic god damned hotel bill to deal with. How would Horatio Alger handle this situation? Stay calm. Stay calm."
raoul.duke,"There's a uh, big machine in the sky, some kind of, I dunno, electric snake, coming straight at us."
raoul.duke,Well? What are your plans?
raoul.duke,Don't take any guff from these fucking swine.
raoul.duke,But our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character. A gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit.
raoul.duke,Last name? I'd rather not say. My brother's in politics.
raoul.duke,"Fuck, you've gone completely sideways, man."
raoul.duke,"What kind of rat bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?"
raoul.duke,Our vibrations were getting nasty. But why? Was there no communication in this car? Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
raoul.duke,"What was I doing here? What was the meaning of this trip? Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind? Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story? Who are these people, these faces? Where do they come from? They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas, and sweet Jesus, there were a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a Sunday morning, still humping the American dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute pre-dawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino."
raoul.duke,"Who are these people? These faces? Where did they come from? They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas, and sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a Sunday morning. Still humping the American dream."
raoul.duke,"I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo, and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things. Won't be long now before they tear us to shreds."
raoul.duke,"The possibility of physical and mental collapse is now very real. No sympathy for the Devil, keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride."
raoul.duke,"Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing - intolerable vibrations in this place. Get out. The weasels were closing in. I could smell the ugly brutes."
raoul.duke,"We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled that 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel."
raoul.duke,Dogs fucked the Pope... no fault of mine.
raoul.duke,"What the fuck? That's fucking machine guns man, they're firing at us! Machine guns! It's a goddamn war zone man get us out of here quick! Quick man! Quick, we're going to be killed for fuck's sake! Oh no, oh God oh God oh God..."
raoul.duke,"That bastard isn't gonna get away with this. I mean, what is going on in this country when a scumsucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism? Can you tell me that?"
raoul.duke,Fuck 'im... I'm gonna miss 'im.
raoul.duke,"In some circles, the Mint 400 is a far far better thing than the Superbowl, the Kentucky Derby, and the lower Oakland roller derby finals all rolled into one. This race attracts a very special breed."
raoul.duke,"You people voted for Hubert Humphrey, and you killed Jesus."
raoul.duke,"Quick, like a bunny."
raoul.duke,"What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole lifestyle that he helped create.

raoul.duke,"You're not Portuguese, man!"
raoul.duke,"She's doing her masters thesis on... well, Barbra Streisand."
raoul.duke,"Yeah, I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime, and I did it anyways. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal, look at me."
raoul.duke,"My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?"
raoul.duke,"The store was closed, but the salesman said he could wait if we hurry. But we were delayed en route when a stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian."
raoul.duke,"Wear some golf shoes, otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive. Impossible to walk in this muck. No footing at all."
raoul.duke,Finish the fucking story man! What happened? What about the glands?
raoul.duke,Take me back to the pits.
raoul.duke,"Of course, I could hear what the clerk was really saying."
raoul.duke,You scurvy shiester bastard. I'm a doctor of journalism man! Get in there and clean your shorts! Clean your shorts goddammit like a big boy!
raoul.duke,"Shit, he's killing himself!"
raoul.duke,Jesus God almighty look at that bunch over there man! They've spotted us!
raoul.duke,Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas. Two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible. Stoned. Ripped. Twisted. Good people.
raoul.duke,"If I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten his breakfast because he's a very crude man."
raoul.duke,"Maybe you could just, uhh, shove me into the pool."
raoul.duke,"Well, they've nailed me goddamnit. I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker. I don't have much time man, the fuckers are closing in! They'll hunt me down like a fucking beast!"
raoul.duke,All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet. What a fool I was to defy him.
raoul.duke,"I'm a relatively respectable citizen. Multiple felon perhaps, but certainly not dangerous."
raoul.duke,"Kill the body, the head will die. Ali-Frazier fight. Crazy shit man."
raoul.duke,Oh god... did you eat all this acid?
raoul.duke,"My attorney had never been able to accept the notion, often espoused by former drug abusers, that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them, and neither have I for that matter."
raoul.duke,"Eat some reds and try to calm down. Smoke some grass, shoot some fucking smack! Shit man, do whatever you gotta do."
raoul.duke,"This is a very ominous assignment, with overtones of extreme personal danger. This is important goddammit, this is a fucking true story!"
raoul.duke,"The telegram is actually all scrambled. It's actually *from* Thompson, not to him. Now I've got to go. I've gotta get to the race."
raoul.duke,We should get some of that.
raoul.duke,"The ether was wearing off. The acid was long gone. But the mescaline was running strong. Good mescaline comes on slow. The first hour is all waiting. Then about halfway through the second hour, you start cursing the creep who burned you because nothing's happening. And then - ZANG!"
raoul.duke,"Madam, sir, baby, child, whatever."
raoul.duke,"Hundred and eleven, twenty-two, THREE!"
raoul.duke,"You people just don't understand! This car is property of the World Bank, that money goes to Italy!"
raoul.duke,I've never missed a plane yet.
raoul.duke,"Don't take any guff from these swine. If you have any trouble, remember, you can always send a telegram to the Right People."
raoul.duke,We cant stop here this is bat country.
