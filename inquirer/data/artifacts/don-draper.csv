don.draper,We should get married.
don.draper,People were buying cigarettes before Freud was born.
don.draper,Let's take it a little slower. I don't want to wake up pregnant.
don.draper,"The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist. What you call love was invented by guys like me, to sell nylons. You're born alone and you die alone and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts. But I never forget. I'm living like there's no tomorrow, because there isn't one."
don.draper,I'm not going to let a woman talk to me like that!
don.draper,This is the greatest advertisting opportunity since the invention of cereal. We have six identical companies making six identical products. We can say anything we want. How do you make your cigarettes?
don.draper,No. Everybody else's tobacco is poisonous. Lucky Strikes'... is toasted.
don.draper,Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And do you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of a road that screams with reassurance that whatever you're doing is OK. You are OK.
don.draper,"All I have is a crush-proof box, and four out of five dead people smoked your brand."
don.draper,"Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail."
don.draper,"I'm late, but you're not. Good work so far."
don.draper,Is this a substance much like bullshit?
don.draper,I gave you more responsibility and you didn't do anything.
don.draper,I don't care if you work ten seconds if you bring me something I like. We're gonna do this right now.
don.draper,That is a roach. Let's go someplace darker.
don.draper,That's how this works. I pay you for ideas.
don.draper,That's what the money is for!
don.draper,"We're going to sit at our desks and keep typing while the walls fall down around us because we're creative - the least important, most important thing there is."
don.draper,And then it killed my business.
don.draper,You haven't said anything about the letter.
don.draper,"Recently my advertising agency ended a long relationship with Lucky Strike cigarettes, and I'm relieved. For over 25 years we devoted ourselves to peddling a product for which good work is irrelevant, because people can't stop themselves from buying it. A product that never improves, that causes illness, and makes people unhappy. But there was money in it. A lot of money. In fact, our entire business depended on it. We knew it wasn't good for us, but we couldn't stop. And then, when Lucky Strike moved their business elsewhere, I realized, here was my chance to be someone who could sleep at night, because I know what I'm selling doesn't kill my customers. So as of today, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce will no longer take tobacco accounts. We know it's going to be hard. If you're interested in cigarette work, here's a list of agencies that do it well: BBDO, Leo Burnett, McCann Erickson, Cutler Gleason & Chaough, and Benton & Bowles. As for us, we welcome all other business because we're certain that our best work is still ahead of us."
don.draper,Answer the question.
don.draper,"He's your new art director too, and you have a deadline. And don't think you can spend Monday hiding behind corners and trying not to make eye contact. I will find you."
don.draper,Go away.
don.draper,"Call the Pen and Pencil, see if someone found my award."
don.draper,"People tell you who they are, but we ignore it - because we want them to be who we want them to be."
don.draper,You want some respect? Go out there and get it for yourself.
don.draper,"When a man walks into a room, he brings his whole life with him. He has a million reasons for being anywhere, just ask him. If you listen, he'll tell you how he got there. How he forgot where he was going, and that he woke up. If you listen, he'll tell you about the time he thought he was an angel or dreamt of being perfect. And then he'll smile with wisdom, content that he realized the world isn't perfect. We're flawed, because we want so much more. We're ruined, because we get these things, and wish for what we had."
don.draper,"Well, that was actually my ex wife, and her husband, and some slob who's about to have the worst dinner of his life."
don.draper,"Listen, Pete, I need you to go get a cardboard box. Put your things in it. Okay?"
don.draper,Remember when I told you about Pete Campbell's last day? It's today.
don.draper,While we were busting our asses on the Bethelem Steel account he was at the Regis Hotel pitching copy. His copy!
don.draper,"I'm enjoying the story so far, but I have a feeling it's not going to end well."
don.draper,What does that mean?
don.draper,"What's it been - four, three hours since the plane went down? You'll have to forgive me for not looking at a bunch of bodies in Jamaica Bay and seeing the opportunity."
don.draper,"Well, that's right. We have the one whose planes didn't just fall out of the sky."
don.draper,We *have* an airline. What kind of company are we going to be?
don.draper,Every day I tried not to think about what would happen if this happened.
don.draper,It's eight o'clock. There's only so much we can pretend like we're doing.
don.draper,I'll probably fall asleep on you.
don.draper,"Says who? Just so you know, the people who talk that way think that monkeys can do this. They take all this monkey crap and stick it in a briefcase, completely unaware that their success depends on something more than shoeshine."
don.draper,You are the product. You feeling something. That's what sells. Not them. Not sex. They can't do what we do and they hate us for it.
don.draper,"Says who? Just so you know, the people who talk that way think that monkeys can do this. They take all this monkey crap and just stick it in a briefcase completely unaware that their success depends on something more than their shoeshine. YOU are the product. You- FEELING something. That's what sells. Not them. Not sex. They can't do what we do, and they hate us for it."
don.draper,I can't decide... if you have everything... or nothing.
don.draper,"I don't wanna play ""what if""."
don.draper,Nothing happened.
don.draper,It's from that book you were all supposed to read.
don.draper,"Chaough said he's in my rear-view mirror. Well, guess what? I'm gonna make a left turn - right off a cliff."
don.draper,But he talks to you.
don.draper,Are you crazy?
don.draper,It's desertion. There's no statute of limitations.
don.draper,What am I supposed to do?
don.draper,Get rid of it.
don.draper,And there are so many real problems in the world.
don.draper,Could have just as easily fired us.
don.draper,"Well, I'm not. I try and stay away from these kinds of shenanigans, but I guess you knew that or you would have told me."
don.draper,"No, I think we're okay."
don.draper,I met somebody and... we're engaged.
don.draper,"I know, I know. It's a surprise. It was for me, too."
don.draper,What's the difference? I fell in love. I didn't mean for this to happen. You've been very important to me.
don.draper,"I hate to break it to you, but there is no big lie, there is no system, the universe is indifferent."
don.draper,"Listen, I'm not here to tell you about Jesus. You already know about Jesus. He either lives in your heart or he doesn't. Every woman wants choices, but in the end, none wants to be one of a hundred in a box. She's unique. She makes the choices and she's chosen him. She wants to tell the world he's MINE. He belongs to ME, not you. She marks her man with her lips. He's her possession. You've given the gift of total ownership."
don.draper,"Nostalgia - it's delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, ""nostalgia"" literally means ""the pain from an old wound."" It's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards... it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called the wheel, it's called the carousel. It let's us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved."
don.draper,What are you doing now?
don.draper,"I'd have my secretary do it, but she's dead."
don.draper,The primaries are still a long way off...
don.draper,I'm easily distracted.
don.draper,Maybe I'm late because I was spending time with my family reading the Bible.
don.draper,"Yes, I am. If it's about my circular, many of the models are gone. But, uh, I'm sure we could find you something."
don.draper,Utopia.
don.draper,"You don't cover for me, you manage expectations."
don.draper,"It's your life. You don't know how long it's gonna last, but you know it doesn't end well. You've gotta move forward... as soon as you can figure out what that means."
don.draper,"In the interest of time, you want to demolish Penn Station and New York hates it."
don.draper,Your concern over public opinion shows a guilty conscience. What good is that serving you if what is to be done is already under way?
don.draper,"Good. And let's also say that change is neither good nor bad, it simply is. It can be greeted with terror or joy, a tantrum that says ""I want it the way it was,"" or a dance that says, Look, something new!"""
don.draper,"I'm not drawing a line at all. P.R. people understand this, but they can never execute it. If you don't like what is being said, then change the conversation."
don.draper,"I was in California. Everything is new, and it's clean. The people are filled with hope. New York City is in decay. But Madison Square Garden is the beginning of a new city on a hill."
don.draper,This never happened. It will shock you how much it never happened.
