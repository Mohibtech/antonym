marsellus,"In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it."
jules,"You, flock of seagulls, you know why we're here? Why don't you tell my man Vincent where you got the shit hid at?"
jules,Hey kids! How you boys doin'?
jules,"Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass."
jules,"Mmmm! Goddamn, Jimmie! This is some serious gourmet shit! Usually, me and Vince would be happy with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice right, but he springs this serious GOURMET shit on us! What flavor is this?"
jules,Whether or not what we experienced was an According to Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is that I felt the touch of God. God got involved.
jules,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing."
jules,"Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing."
marsellus,"You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers. Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine. If you mean it turns to vinegar, it does. If you mean it gets better with age, it don't."
jules,We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
jules,"Now Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?"
jules,"Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?"
jules,What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
jules,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?"
marsellus,"The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting. That's pride fucking with you. Fuck pride. Pride only hurts, it never helps."
jules,"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
marsellus,"I'm prepared to scour the the Earth for that motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger waiting in a bowl of rice ready to pop a cap in his ass."
jules,"I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs. All I wanna hear from your ass is, You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the calvary which should be coming directly."
jules,"I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet."
jules,Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
jules,"Fuck, nigga, what the fuck did you do to his towel?"
jules,If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.
jules,"This was Divine Intervention! You know what ""divine intervention"" is?"
jules,"Hey, that's Kool and the Gang."
jules,"You remember Antoine Roccamora, half black, half Samoan, used to call him Tony Rocky Horror?"
jules,You know the shows on TV?
jules,Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
jules,Do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?
jules,"Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger"
jules,Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?
jules,"My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit."
jules,I'll just walk the earth.
jules,"Bitch, be cool!"
jules,"Look, do you wanna play blindman? Go walk with the shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fucking open."
jules,"Shut the fuck up, fat man!"
jules,"Yolanda? How we doin, baby?"
jules,"So, tell me again about the hashbars?"
