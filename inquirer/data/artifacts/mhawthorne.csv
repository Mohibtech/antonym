mhawthorne,"Chapter 2: Like Doubles in Tennis, but with Knives"
mhawthorne,"I have good days and bad days like everyone else, just more extreme."
mhawthorne,"I'm the charmer who will tell you how beautiful you are, then fuck you and drain the life out of you like a balloon."
mhawthorne,I'll steal your soul and leave the skin behind.
mhawthorne,"And I'm the needy, pathetic shell of a man who feels empty unless he can totally, emphatically dominate you."
mhawthorne,I'll demand that you never wear pants.
mhawthorne,"Every time you walk by, I'll grab you and bite your ass, leaving teeth marks on your left cheek and the panties that cover it."
mhawthorne,"I think I've romanticized you, and now I use you like a crutch, except it doesn't work anymore, and I'm disappointed when I realize that we don't really have anything to say to each other."
mhawthorne,I'm obsessed with you and I barely know you.
mhawthorne,I'm sick.
mhawthorne,"I feel like I have to hide things from you, because I'm a mutant in competition with nice, normal guys."
mhawthorne,"This is all so stupid and sometimes I wish I never met you and I wish I could freeze time, like Hiro, then walk into your cube and tap you, you'd come to life and I'd take your hand and we'd run away and walk through the streets and everyone would be frozen, the people, the cars, the sun in the sky, the world would be ours, to pluck, and smother, and inhale."
mhawthorne,"""You"" are a figment of my fucking imagination, a beautiful lily-white savior for me to worship and destroy."
mhawthorne,"""I"" am a broken manifestation of your sexual boredom and curiosity, like a vibrator with no batteries that talks too much and complains if you don't use it every day."
mhawthorne,I want to put my nose on your neck and smell you.
mhawthorne,I want to pull your hair and bite you.
mhawthorne,I have absolutely no sense of self control.
mhawthorne,I want to break you open and eat you like a cantaloupe.
mhawthorne,"I'm so fucked up that when I thought long and hard about this, the most sensible solution I came up with was to ""find another woman so I can stop bothering #x""."
mhawthorne,"Yes, I actually wrote that down, like it was such a great idea that I didn't want to forget it."
mhawthorne,Dr. Practical is now accepting patients.
mhawthorne,"You make me feel things I've never felt in my life and it's all so incredibly lame and even this is a performance and I'm so, so sorry that this happened to you."
mhawthorne,You should have known better when you looked in my eyes.
mhawthorne,"There is no ""that"" without ""this""."
mhawthorne,"Know one thing about me: I'm not like you, I'm not smart enough to not click ""Send""."
mhawthorne,"Ahh, I feel a bit better now!  Take that, restraint!"
