walter.sobchak,"When we make the handoff, I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! Huh?"
the.dude,"Fuck sympathy! I don't need your fuckin' sympathy, man, I need my fucking johnson!"
the.dude,"God damn you Walter! You fuckin' asshole! Everything's a fuckin' travesty with you, man! And what was all that shit about Vietnam? What the FUCK, has anything got to do with Vietnam? What the fuck are you talking about?"
walter.sobchak,"You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me."
the.dude,Walter... what am I going to tell Lebowski?
walter.sobchak,"I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money. My point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life or death..."
the.dude,"Also, my rug was stolen."
the.dude,"These are, uh..."
the.dude,"Walter, what is the point? Look, we all know who is at fault here, what the fuck are you talking about?"
walter.sobchak,"Nihilists! Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."
the.dude,"Look, just stay away from my fucking lady friend."
the.dude,"Well, they finally did it. They killed my fucking car."
the.dude,Where's the fucking money Lebowski?
the.dude,Who the fuck are the Knutsens?
the.dude,"Walter, ya know, it's Smokey, so his toe slipped over the line a little, big deal. It's just a game, man."
walter.sobchak,"Shut the fuck up, Donny."
the.dude,"It's like what Lenin said... you look for the person who will benefit, and, uh, uh..."
the.dude,"Hey, careful, man, there's a beverage here!"
the.dude,"And, you know, he's got emotional problems, man."
jesus.quintana,"What's this day of rest shit? What's this bullshit? I don't fuckin' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus. This bush league psyche-out stuff. Laughable, man - ha ha! I would have fucked you in the ass Saturday. I fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead. Wooo! You got a date Wednesday, baby!"
walter.sobchak,Fucking dipshit with a nine toed woman.
the.dude,"Fuckin' Quintana... that creep can roll, man."
jesus.quintana,"You ready to be fucked, man? I see you rolled your way into the semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up."
jesus.quintana,Nobody fucks with the Jesus!
the.dude,Mind if I do a J?
walter.sobchak,"Your wheel! At fifteen m-p-h I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi!"
the.dude,What's in the fuckin' carrier?
walter.sobchak,"Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling."
the.dude,"Jesus, man, can you change the station?"
the.dude,"I mean we totally fucked it up man, we fucked up this payoff, we got the kidnappers all mad at us, and Lebowski, ya know, he yelled at me a lot but he didn't do anything, huh?"
walter.sobchak,"You have got to buck up, man. You cannot drag this negative energy in to the tournament!"
the.dude,"Jesus, man, could you change the channel?"
the.dude,"Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man."
walter.sobchak,Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
the.dude,"Yeah, well. The Dude abides."
the.dude,"Did you ever hear of ""The Seattle Seven""?"
walter.sobchak,"He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger..."
walter.sobchak,Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing... I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet...
walter.sobchak,"I told that Kraut a fuckin' thousand times, I don't roll on shabbos!"
the.dude,"Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug, uh, regimen to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber."
walter.sobchak,"Were you listening to The Dude's story, Donny?"
the.dude,"I dropped off the money exactly as per... look, man, I've got certain information, all right? Certain things have come to light. And, you know, has it ever occurred to you, that, instead of, uh, you know, running around, uh, uh, blaming me, you know, given the nature of all this new shit, you know, I-I-I-I... this could be a-a-a-a lot more, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, complex, I mean, it's not just, it might not be just such a simple... uh, you know?"
walter.sobchak,OVER THE LINE!
the.dude,"Oh, Jesus, what's that smell, man?"
walter.sobchak,"The man in the black pajamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary."
the.dude,"You thought that Bunny had been kidnapped and you were fuckin' glad, man. You could use it as an excuse to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on! You'd just met me! You human... paraquat! You figured 'Oh, here's a loser', you know? A deadbeat, someone the square community won't give a shit about."
the.dude,"Do you find them much, these, stolen cars?"
walter.sobchak,"Now so far, we have what appears to me to be a series of victimless crimes."
the.dude,"Let me explain something to you. Um, I am not ""Mr. Lebowski"". You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."
walter.sobchak,Am I wrong?
the.dude,My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
walter.sobchak,"Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit, they're not gonna do shit. What can they do? They're a bunch of fuckin' amateurs, and meanwhile, look at the bottom line: Who's sittin' on a million fuckin' dollars? Am I wrong?"
the.dude,Oh boy. How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen Karl Hungus.
walter.sobchak,"Whereas what we have here? A bunch of fig-eaters wearing towels on their heads, trying to find reverse in a Soviet tank. This is not a worthy adversary."
walter.sobchak,"That's right, Dude, they peed on your fucking rug."
walter.sobchak,"Also, let's not forget - let's *not* forget, Dude - that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city - that aint legal either."
walter.sobchak,Look at our current situation with that camel fucker over in Iraq. Pacifism is not something to hide behind.
the.dude,"Hey, nice marmot!"
the.dude,"Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man."
the.dude,This is the fuckin' guy! I can find this fuckin' Lebowski guy!
the.dude,"Yes, Walter, you're right. There is an unspoken message here. It's ""FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!"" Yeah, I'll be at practice."
the.dude,"Who the fuck are you, man?"
walter.sobchak,"Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors... and bowling, and as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California, from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo and... up to... Pismo. He died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at Khe Sanh, at Langdok, at Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And so would Donny. Donny, who loved bowling. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Good night, sweet prince."
the.dude,At least I'm housebroken.
the.dude,I'm sorry your stepmother is a nympho.
the.dude,"Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron."
the.dude,Just take it easy man.
the.dude,"Ah, fuck it."
the.dude,"Oh, fuck me, man! That kid already spent all the money, man!"
walter.sobchak,"Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit."
the.dude,I could be just sitting at home with pee stains on my rug.
walter.sobchak,"GOD DAMN IT! Look, just because we're bereaved, that doesn't make us saps!"
the.dude,I only said I THOUGHT she kidnapped herself. You're the one who's so fucking certain!
walter.sobchak,"Etz chaim he dude, as the ex used to say."
the.dude,"Look, nothing is fucked, here, man."
walter.sobchak,"Now that is just ridiculous, Dude. Nobody is going to cut your dick off. Not if I have anything to say about it."
walter.sobchak,"Is this your homework, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?"
walter.sobchak,"That's not her toe, Dude."
the.dude,"H-hey, this is a private residence, man!"
the.dude,Ow! Fucking fascist!
the.dude,"Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. Real fucking brat, but I'm sure your goons can get it off him. I mean, he's fifteen."
the.dude,So if you could just write me my check for ten percent of a half a million... five grand... I'll go out and mingle.
walter.sobchak,"You know, Dude, I myself dabbled in pacifism once. Not in 'Nam of course."
the.dude,"By the way, do you think that you could give me that $20,000 in cash? My concern is, and I have to, uh, check with my accountant, that this might bump me into a higher, uh, tax..."
the.dude,We dropped off the damn money...
the.dude,"Uh, and then, uh, the music business, briefly."
the.dude,What do you do?
walter.sobchak,"Fifteen, Dude. This is it. Let's take that hill!"
the.dude,"Hey, no, come on, Walter. We're ending this thing cheap, man."
walter.sobchak,"Call the medics, Dude. I'd go myself but I'm pumping blood. Might pass out. Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine. We got help choppering in."
walter.sobchak,Anti-semite!
walter.sobchak,Am I wrong?
walter.sobchak,The little prick is stonewalling me.
walter.sobchak,"Lady, I got buddies who died face down in the muck so that you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!"
the.dude,Would you just calm down?
