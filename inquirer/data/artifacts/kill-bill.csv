the.bride,"And what, pray tell, is the five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique?"
the.bride,"Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. This time, you're a hundred per cent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world. But right now... I'm just scared shitless for my baby. Please, just look at the strip. *Please*."
the.bride,"Bitch, you don't have a future."
the.bride,"Guess that makes him a liar, don't it?"
the.bride,"I was wondering, just between us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye?"
the.bride,"May I have a glass of water, please?"
the.bride,"Now, the incident that happened at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel that put this whole gory story into motion, has since become legend. ""Massacre At Two Pines"". That's what the newspapers called it. The local TV news called it, ""The El Paso, Texas, Wedding Chapel Massacre"". How it happened, who was there, how many got killed and who killed them - changes depending on who's telling the story. In actual fact, the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all. It was a wedding rehearsal."
the.bride,"On the floor, by the door, is a strip that says I'm pregnant."
the.bride,"Ooh, bad idea."
the.bride,"Well, I'm flattered."
the.bride,"Well, guess what, bitch? I'm better than Annie Oakley and I've got you right in my sights, so let's talk."
the.bride,"You ""overreacted""? Is that your explanation?"
the.bride,"You know, five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that would never happen, you performing a coup de grace on me, by busting a cap in my crown, would have been right at the top of the list. But I'd be wrong, wouldn't I?"
the.bride,Do I look pretty?
the.bride,Euphoria?
the.bride,How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?
the.bride,I don't know... because I'm a bad person.
the.bride,My Pussy Wagon died on me.
the.bride,Why are you here?
the.bride,You and I have unfinished business.
the.bride,You any good with that shotgun?
the.bride,You look ready.
the.bride,You promised you'd be nice.
the.bride,You want to come to the wedding?
the.bride,You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.
pai.mei,"Elle, you treacherous dog. I give you my word..."
pai.mei,"It's my arm now, I'll do what I want with it."
pai.mei,"Then you can't do it. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through him?"
pai.mei,Are you aware I kill at will?
pai.mei,Is it your wish to die?
pai.mei,Then you must be stupid... so stupid.
